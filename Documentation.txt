VTZFileParser

This application is the initial steps of an attempt to greatly reduce the amount of time required to manager a VT Pro Project.

The application, does the following:

Given a .vtz file, it reads its contents and creates:
- A .csv file containing all the defined Analog, Digital and Serial Joins
- a .dll file which contains an enumeration of the defined Analog, Digital and Serial Joins

The application is written in VS2017, as a result the .dll that it outputs cannot be brought into VS2008.

However, it can be for Virtual Control Applications.
